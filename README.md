# Automonventure

A silly text based adventure game written in Ruby, it's loosely based on the crazy people I worked with at a company called "Automon". This will contain a lot of inside jokes and probably not be very funny except to like three people, but I needed someting to build to get a bit more familiar with ruby outside of just rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'automonventure'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install automonventure

## Running the app

For debug mode
    $ ./bin/console

For normal running
    $ ruby ./lib/automonventure.rb
    
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
